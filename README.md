I'm a developer eager for new learning experiences. For almost six years, I have worked as an architect, working in several areas of the sector, including management. However, despite not losing interest in the profession, I found myself in technology, a field that highlighted my taste for logic and innovation.

Currently, I am studying to be a Full Stack web developer. These are some technologies that I have been developing: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, GIT, and so on.
