I'm a developer eager for new learning experiences. Graduated in architecture, I have worked in several areas of the sector, including management. However, despite not losing interest in the profession, I found myself in technology, an area that highlighted my taste for logic and innovation.

Currently studying to be a Full Stack web developer. These are some technologies that I have been developing: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, GIT and so on.
